Alarm clock with unusual features.

TIP: In Progress...

== Features

Expected capabilities:

.Normal features:
* Display Date and Time
* Setup alarm clock
* Buzz

.Advanced features:
* Project Time on wall
* Play MP3 instead of Buzz
* Slowly light up
* Meteo for today or next day

.Unseen features:
* Display using e-Ink
* Allow for each day of week distinct time or no alarm
* Disable alarm before buzz time, for when you wake up earlier and to avoid buzz the house on that day
* Allow for a range-time alarm instead of fixed time, to randomize a little each days
* Setup remotely through a connected channel
* Reminder for today/next day event(s)

== Hardware

Possible hardware:

* ESP32
* Pico Pi W (no bluetooth !)

== Questions

Here are few unknown:

* How to project on wall? Should re-use a component?
* Which device or protocol to setup?
This seems nowadays easier to setup through a mobile app.
Thanks to chat channels, this may be even easier to "ask" a bot assistant.
